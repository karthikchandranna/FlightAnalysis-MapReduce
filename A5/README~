The submitted tar file contains the following:
1) Source files
2) Report detailing design and implementation
3) The executable JAR
4) Makefile


Steps for running the program on AWS:

Step 1: In the given Makefile, please assign values to the following:
	a) AWS_ACCESS_KEY
	b) AWS_SECRET_KEY
	c) CLUSTER_NAME
	d) BUCKET
	e) OUTPUT_DIR

Step 2: Make sure the S3 bucket that is specified has the following:
	a) input/all or input/<full dataset>
	b) logs

	The JAR file will be uploaded to the specified S3 bucket from the Makefile

Step 3: cd to the path of the Makefile and Run the target aws using "make aws" 

Step 4: Please wait until the cluster is terminated successfully. You can check the status of the cluster execution on Amazon AWS EMR web console.

Step 5: Once the cluster is terminated successfully, run the target result using "make result"

Step 6: The final output will be in the results.csv file in the path from which the Makefile was run. The output format is as follows:
	"DL,2014,48633519,1376486" (format)
