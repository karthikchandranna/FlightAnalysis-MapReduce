The tar file has the following contents:

1) JAR file of the single threaded application
2) JAR file of the multi threaded application
3) JAR file of the pseudo-distributed implementation of the application
4) JAR file of the cluster implementation (AWS)
5) A Makefile that contains the targets to run the above applications.
6) A report that has the R Script and the R Graph that compares the execution times of the above implementations.
7) Source files


Execution Instructions:

Step 1: Change Directory (cd) to the path of the Makefile.

Step 2:	
	a). Single threaded application usage:
		java jar Karthik_Sujith_A3.jar <path of input folder> <mean or median> <number of files>

	b). Multi-threaded application usage:
		java jar Karthik_Sujith_A3_Multi.jar <path of input folder> <mean or median> <number of files>

	c). Pseudo distributed mode:
		hadoop fs -mkdir <new_directory_name>
        	hadoop fs -put <path to input dataset> <new_directory_name>
        	hadoop jar <pseudo jar file given> <path to input dataset>/all <new output directory> <mean/median/fastMedian> <numberOfFiles>

	d). AWS Clusters:
		Follow the instructions in the makefile.

Alternatively, you can run the targets in the makefile.


[Note: Number of files is one 5,10,15,20,25]
