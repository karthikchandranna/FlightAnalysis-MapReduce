README:

The submitted tar file contains the following:
1) Source files
2) Report detailing design and implementation
3) Makefile

The executable JAR is on s3://sujithkarthik/job.jar
Please sync it using the following command:

aws s3 sync s3://sujithkarthik/job.jar .


Steps for running the program on AWS:

Step 1: In the given Makefile, please assign values to the following:

	g) PATH_TO_VALIDATION_FILE

Step 2: Make sure the S3 bucket that is specified has the following:
	a) input/forest_data or input/<full dataset>
	b) logs
	c) a6Test or the test dataset
	

Step 3: cd to the path of the Makefile and Run the target aws using "make aws" 

Step 4: Please wait until the cluster is terminated successfully. You can check the status of the cluster execution on Amazon AWS EMR web console.
